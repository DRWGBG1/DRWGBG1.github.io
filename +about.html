            <br /> I am a Simulations design major with a minor in business. I am currently a senior but
            changed my major recently. I am pursuing my bachelor's degree currently. I expect to
            graduate from the University of Missouri in 2024. After school, I plan to work a job
            involving design. I attended high school in Chicago which is a reason I am in design due
            to the art and massive buildings.<br />

              <br />Hi! My name is Danny Waldron I am a <strong>senior</strong> studying simulation design with a minor in Business.
              I was originally a business major but decided it was not for me so I changed. I do not have any experience in
              web development besides running a website for a local shelter in Columbia but I did not learn much. It was
              mostly just updating events and requesting clothing for drives. Not much coding experience was necessary. <br />
              I expect to have a much better understanding of how to navigate code and run a website when I finish the course.
              I hope to use what I learn in this course in my future job which I hope is in design. My favorite hobby is
              playing working out. I do not have much free time but when I do I mainly hang out with my friends in downtown
              Columbia or play video games. </div>
