 Hi, welcome to my website. My name is Danny Waldron. The purpose of the website is 
        to show attractions in different countries through incredible photos. Unique landscapes 
        with thorough explanations are included as well. I would like this website to really stand 
        out, have unique designs and have viewers wanting to see more locations. I have traveled 
        a lot and showing art and landscapes will make it special. Showing different cultures 
        gives you an interesting experience into how other people live. If you cannot travel I hope 
        this portfolio gives you insight into how special the world is.
