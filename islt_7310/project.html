 <h1>Projects and Experiences</h1>
 <h3 class="Top-header">Projects and experience</h3>
<p> In school learning competencies I developed were leadership, emotional intelligence, and self-
    management. I displayed leadership by completing the most difficult parts of a BA 3500 group 
    essay. I also planned all the meetings and spoke the most in meetings while developing the 
    essay. Finally, I submitted all final reports to the teaching assistant. The paper was on housing in 
    the Columbia area. I learned planning and managing time is essential to success and 
    understanding the client can gain a large amount of information which can lead in helping them. </p>

    <p>I would research and look at the focus of the project from a different perspective. I showed emotional 
        intelligence during my BA 2500 project. The focus was to aid the poor through editing a local homeless 
        shelters website and running their social media accounts. The purpose was to make people aware of 
        the clothing and food drives that were occurring. They were too busy and could not run it. I updated 
        everything and got the shelter more attraction.  </p>
    <H3>Other Experiences</H3>
    <p>This really improved my IT skills and communication skills. It helped me understand people better and 
        made me more aware of the impact social media has. I consistently used adobe; I also did large amounts 
        of research on the homeless crisis in Missouri. 
         </p>
    <p>For a public speaking course, I had to write an essay and complete a presentation on pollution. I 
        displayed self-management by carrying my own workload on a project. My partner did the same. We 
        studied pollution in Columbia and researched pollution in other countries such as Russia and China. We 
        each did research and put our findings together to form a good essay. This project allowed me to rely on 
        others but also aided me in planning. It helped me understand key points instead of just including non-
        essential statements.
